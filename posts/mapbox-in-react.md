In the below video I'll show you how to Implement **Mapbox** into a **React** component.  

Here are the **rough** steps to accomplish this.

- Implementing a Vite project and installing the mapbox dependencies
- Safely adding a mapbox token to your project
- Adding inline styles to ensure the map displays correctly
- Add a geocoder to search for locations and fly to the location

While I have implemented Mapbox into numerous projects this was the first time I've recorded myself while coding.  

I learned I need to eliminate a lot of filler words, as well as how to edit videos. Now that I've figured out my workflow I'll do more videos soon!

Enough talking...[here is the video](https://youtu.be/6HqToh9SUtU)

Thanks for watching!
